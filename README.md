# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we will also access imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Our goal in this analysis is the application of machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. Resampling is necessary in assessing credit risk as it is an an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.

## Results
 The following images and bulleted list describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models:

RandomOverSampler Results:
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: .505
  - Precision: 99
  - Recall: 99
